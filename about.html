            <h3>Experience Developing This Website</h3>
            <p>This website was developed as part of my Assignment in web development. The website features a home page, a shop page with categories for men's and women's clothing, a cart page, and an about page. The development process involved the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing the layout and structure of the website using HTML.</li>
                <li>Styling the website with CSS to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design.</li>
                <li>Implementing interactive features using JavaScript, such as adding items to the cart and dynamically updating the cart's content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5: For structuring the content of the website.</li>
                <li>CSS3: For styling and layout of the website, ensuring responsiveness and a modern look.</li>
                <li>JavaScript: For adding interactive elements, such as cart functionality and dynamic content updates.</li>
            </ul>
